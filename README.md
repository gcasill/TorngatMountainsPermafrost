# Permafrost Active Layer Depth--Torngat Mountains

Permafrost Active Layer Depth--Torngat Mountains is permafrost soil data taken from the Ivitak Cove in the Torngat Mountains of the providence Newfoundland, Canada. The soil temperature readings in Celsius were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 meters deep beginning in 2010 to 2017. Researcher Darroch Whitaker of Parks Canada is the current publisher of the data being hosted on Open Government Canada.

## Repository

The Arctic Permafrost Geospatial Centre [(APGC)](https://apgc.awi.de/), an open access data catalogue, hosted and maintained by the Alfred-Wegener-Institut (AWI)'s Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research would be ideal discipline specific repository to contact in order for data to be hosted and best used to contribute to global permafrost data.

## Metadata File Types

Metadata file types include .XML, .JSON, and .JSONLD.

.XML is a schema to describe data in a hierarchal format. It's human and machine readable. It can be used to store data and be used in a programming environment.

.JSON is also a descriptive and readable scheuma, but provides users with the ability to store JavaScript objects in text format. JavaScript objects can be sent and received via .JSON. It is shorter, quicker to read, and is easier to fetch data from.

.JSONLD is similar to .JSON but uses .JSON to serialize Linked Data. .JSONLD uses Linked Data in web programming environments, can be used to build interoperable web services, and uses Linked Data in engines that use .JSON.
